How to execute scripts:

Mesh Network Script

Ad Hoc Network Script
bash adHocNetworkScript.sh <IP address> <channel frequency in Mhz> <NOHT|HT20|HT40+>


Mesh Network Startup Script (used to automatically join mesh network on startup)

change the IP address in the setMeshPointStartupScript.sh to the desired IP for the device.
Then run the following command:
